# lenet5-mnist-digits

This is keras implementation for MNIST Digits classification using LeNet-5. 

MNIST Digits is a database of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 handwritten digits, which includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test imnages. 

LeNet-5 is a Convolutional Neural Network proposed by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998. The network consists of 5 parametarized layers ~ 60,000 parameters. Attached is the architecture of the network and its summary table:
